# Introduction to CS Theory with Mark Erickson

## About

Join us and Mark Erickson as he attempts to condense 2-3 years of grad level math and CS theory into a short and approachable talk. He will cover some core concepts and takeaways from theory that will generally hold up to further scrutiny, but with much of the detail omitted for brevity.
