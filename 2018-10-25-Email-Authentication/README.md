# Email Authentication: Essential for Email Deliverability and Security

Email authentication, including Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), is essential to protect your domain name and your company’s reputation.

Unprotected, spammers and phishers can send email using your domain name, with mailbox providers provided no mechanism to discern legitimate email from illegitimate sent spoofing your domain name.

Since most spammers hide their identity by sending From other people’s domain names, it’s critical that you configure email authentication for all domain names that you own.

Neil Anuskiewicz, a DNS and email expert, will describe the problems caused by incomplete or incorrectly implemented email authentication and walk through how to implement complete email authentication, including tools to validate email authentication and a tool to make reading DMARC reports easy.
